Input Devices
Device	Description
Barcode	A hand-held scanner used to read the group of thick and thin lines (called a barcode) printed on various products. The barcode is linked to a database that contains information on the product.
Biometric Device	Allows access to a computer or device by identifying a person through one of their unique physical characteristics, such as finger or hand prints, retina or iris patterns, voice or facial recognition, etc.
Camcorder	A hand-held device used to record live-action video and audio. Originally, camcorders recorded 
Digital Camera	A hand-held device that records still images digitally instead of on photographic film. Digital cameras are limited by their maximum resolution and the number of colors they can represent.
Digitizer	Used to convert hand-drawn pictures into digital images that can be manipulated using computer software. You draw on the digitizer's screen and what you draw is digitally rendered into the computer.
Signature Pad	Used to digitize handwritten signatures, for example, to accept credit card signatures at the point of sale terminals. Some signature pads are designed to use a stylus while others are signed with a finger.
Gamepad	A hand-held device used to play video games. A gamepad can contain buttons, thumb sticks, joy pads, and triggers. It is held between both hands and controlled using your thumbs.
Joystick	A device that controls the movement of the cursor on the screen. A joystick can also contain buttons. Typically used for gaming or graphics.
Microphone	A device used to input audio into a computer. Microphones can connect using the "mic" port on the computer sound card, to a USB port, or can be built-in. Microphones have many uses including: VoIP, voice recognition, gaming, online chat, dictation, and podcasts. Microphones are often built into laptop computers.
Motion Sensor	An electronic sensor that detects physical motion in an environment. In computers and other electronic devices, motion sensors can be used for "waking up" the device, entering data using gestures, gaming input, start or stop video recording, and more.
Scanner	Captures printed photos and images for editing on a computer. Scanner types include hand held, flatbed, or automatic document feeder (ADF). Some scan in black and white only; others can do both black and white, and color.
Smart Card Reader	Smart cards are about the size of a credit card and used to store information. To access the information stored on the card you use a smart card reader. Smart card readers are configured to read specific types of cards. For example, some card readers are designed to read information off a magnetic strip; others read information off a microchip embedded on the card; some can do both. Smart cards can provide authentication and encryption, making them safe for financial transactions.
NFC Reader	Reads contactless payment cards or inventory tracking tags using near field communication&nbsp;technologies. Depending on the exact technology used the tag may need to be tapped against the reader, or simply be brought nearby
Webcam	Reads contactless payment cards or inventory tracking tags using near field communication technologies. Depending on the exact technology used the tag may need to be tapped against the reader, or simply be brought nearby.

Display Issues
Issue	Symptom	Potential Causes
Artifacts	The computer crashes, leaving digital boxes from the image on the screen	Data connections not secure / GPU Overheating / GPU Driver Corrupt
Blank Screen on Boot	The windows logo appears during boot, then the screen goes blank	Incompatible or corrupt graphics driver
Burn-in	Faint, Permanent images appear on the screen	Fixed image is displayed on screen for an extended period /Phosphor burn in CRTs / Pixel deterioration in LCD / Use Screen Savers
Color Patterns incorrect	Colors Appear faded, muted, too dark or bright	Data connections not secure / Adjust settings / CRT: mintor needs degaussing
Dead Pixels	a pixel does not change color. It appears all black, red, green, etc	No voltage is getting to the one pixel / Sometimes turning off the display will reset deat pixels to their original state.
Dim Image	Not enough blacklight to view pixels clearly	Brightness Level / On a latop, the power plan is set to dim the display.
Distorted Geometry	Wraping of an immage so that a fixed point appears off axis (Barrel and Pincushion Distortion)	Common in display projectors. Caused by a defect in optic lens system. Adjust keystone setting.
Distorted Image	Image appears skewed, or off-centered	Typically caused by power problems or from other large appliances drawing from the same power source. Try using a new power source
Flickering Image	Image Wavers or varies in brightness on the screen.	Data connections loose. / Display not supported(so lower resolution settings)/ Incompatible drivers
Overheat shutdown	Screen turns black but computer is still on	Typically an issue with high end graphics cards. Cooling systems aren't operating, too hot environment, overclocked hardware
Oversized Images	Icons, font, etc are too big	Windows Diisplay settings for the size of the text/icons and set them to the correct settings.

++++answer: 1GHz
++++answer: 10kHz
Twisted-pair Standards
Common Name	ISO/IEC 11801	Frequency	Description/Use
Cat 1	Class A	100kHz	Low speed cable used for older voice telephone installations. Not for use in data networks.
Cat 2	Class B	1Mhz	Used in older data networks like ARCnet and early Token Ring.
Cat 3	Class C	16MHz	Used in early Etheret; unsuitable for faster networks, but still used for voice telephone cables.
Cat 4	Not Standard	20MHz	Used by early Ethernet and some Token Ring networks, but was never common.
Cat 5	Class D	100MHz	Widely used for Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet networks, also used for telepone and video. Superseded by Cat5e.
Cat 6	Class E	250MHz	Stronger crosstalk specifications than Cat5e. Popular for new Gigabiit Ethernet installations, and short distance 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks. Frequnetly shileded for addtional EMI protection; if so, the shielding needs a grounded connection.
Cat 6A	Class Ea	500MHz	Augmented Category 6. Shilded, and allows ful distance 10 gigabit Ethernet operation.
Cat 7	Class F	600MHz	Similar to Cat6A, but screened and shilded for higher noise resistance.
Cat 7A	Class Fa	1000MHz	Augmented Category 7. Maybe suitable for emerging 40 Gigabit Ethernet.


Twisted-pair Connection Troubleshooting
Problem	Impact	Description/Cause	Solution
Short	No Signal	Contact between two wires that should be separate. May be intermittent.	Replace the faulty cable.
Open	No Signal	A break in a connection that should be continuous. Maybe intermittent.	Ensure all cables are fimrly connected. Replace the faulty cable.
Attenuation	Noise	Cable too long, or cable resistance too high.	Replace with higher grade cable; use a shorter cable; segment the cable with repeaters
Bad cable or connector	Noise or no signal	Defective component, or just a lower wiring standard.	Replace the cable.
EMI	Noise	Interference from external electrical or radio sources. Can be intermittent depending on those sources.	Isolate the cable from interference by rerouting the cable, moving the source, or adding shielding.
Crosstalk	Noise	Interference between two wire pairs.	Replace the cable, possible with internally shielded U/FTP.
Wrong termination Standard	Wrong Signal	One end terminated in the wrong wire order. Never intermittent.	Remove one end and terminate it correctly. Use the same standard on both ends.
Network hardware failure	Noise or no signal	Failure in physical device such as a NIC or modular transceiver.	Ensure device is powered on and functioning. Replace faulty component.
Speed or duplex mismatch	Slow or no connection	Both ends manually set to an inefficient speed or duplex setting, each ebd set to a different speed or duplex setting, or devices unable to automatically negotiate mutually compatible settings.	Fix device settings. Replace cable. Replace on device.

RG Standards
Name	Core Diameter	Outside Diameter	Impedance	Uses
RG-59	0.64 mm	6.1 mm	75 ohms	Common for basebane video and older cable televison systems. Not reliable for broadband network connections.
RG-6	1 mm	6.86 mm	75 ohms	Standard for newer digital cable, satellite, and cable modem connections. Essntially a higher grade RG-59.
RG-11	1.63 mm	10.5 mm	75 ohms	used for the same purposes as RG-6, but usually only for long distance drops and undeground cables.
RG-08	2.17 mm	10.3 mm	50 ohms	Used by 10BASE5 "Thicknet" Ethernet, the first Ethernet standard. Now obsolete.
RG-58	0.81 mm	5.0 mm	50 ohms	Used by 10BASE2 "Thinnet" Ethernet, a cheaper but more limited alernative to Thicknet. Also Obsolete.
