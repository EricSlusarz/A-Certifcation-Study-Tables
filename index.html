Input Devices
Device	Description
Barcode	A hand-held scanner used to read the group of thick and thin lines (called a barcode) printed on various products. The barcode is linked to a database that contains information on the product.
Biometric Device	Allows access to a computer or device by identifying a person through one of their unique physical characteristics, such as finger or hand prints, retina or iris patterns, voice or facial recognition, etc.
Camcorder	A hand-held device used to record live-action video and audio. Originally, camcorders recorded 
Digital Camera	A hand-held device that records still images digitally instead of on photographic film. Digital cameras are limited by their maximum resolution and the number of colors they can represent.
Digitizer	Used to convert hand-drawn pictures into digital images that can be manipulated using computer software. You draw on the digitizer's screen and what you draw is digitally rendered into the computer.
Signature Pad	Used to digitize handwritten signatures, for example, to accept credit card signatures at the point of sale terminals. Some signature pads are designed to use a stylus while others are signed with a finger.
Gamepad	A hand-held device used to play video games. A gamepad can contain buttons, thumb sticks, joy pads, and triggers. It is held between both hands and controlled using your thumbs.
Joystick	A device that controls the movement of the cursor on the screen. A joystick can also contain buttons. Typically used for gaming or graphics.
Microphone	A device used to input audio into a computer. Microphones can connect using the "mic" port on the computer sound card, to a USB port, or can be built-in. Microphones have many uses including: VoIP, voice recognition, gaming, online chat, dictation, and podcasts. Microphones are often built into laptop computers.
Motion Sensor	An electronic sensor that detects physical motion in an environment. In computers and other electronic devices, motion sensors can be used for "waking up" the device, entering data using gestures, gaming input, start or stop video recording, and more.
Scanner	Captures printed photos and images for editing on a computer. Scanner types include hand held, flatbed, or automatic document feeder (ADF). Some scan in black and white only; others can do both black and white, and color.
Smart Card Reader	Smart cards are about the size of a credit card and used to store information. To access the information stored on the card you use a smart card reader. Smart card readers are configured to read specific types of cards. For example, some card readers are designed to read information off a magnetic strip; others read information off a microchip embedded on the card; some can do both. Smart cards can provide authentication and encryption, making them safe for financial transactions.
NFC Reader	Reads contactless payment cards or inventory tracking tags using near field communication&nbsp;technologies. Depending on the exact technology used the tag may need to be tapped against the reader, or simply be brought nearby
Webcam	Reads contactless payment cards or inventory tracking tags using near field communication technologies. Depending on the exact technology used the tag may need to be tapped against the reader, or simply be brought nearby.

Display Issues
Issue	Symptom	Potential Causes
Artifacts	The computer crashes, leaving digital boxes from the image on the screen	Data connections not secure / GPU Overheating / GPU Driver Corrupt
Blank Screen on Boot	The windows logo appears during boot, then the screen goes blank	Incompatible or corrupt graphics driver
Burn-in	Faint, Permanent images appear on the screen	Fixed image is displayed on screen for an extended period /Phosphor burn in CRTs / Pixel deterioration in LCD / Use Screen Savers
Color Patterns incorrect	Colors Appear faded, muted, too dark or bright	Data connections not secure / Adjust settings / CRT: mintor needs degaussing
Dead Pixels	a pixel does not change color. It appears all black, red, green, etc	No voltage is getting to the one pixel / Sometimes turning off the display will reset deat pixels to their original state.
Dim Image	Not enough blacklight to view pixels clearly	Brightness Level / On a latop, the power plan is set to dim the display.
Distorted Geometry	Wraping of an immage so that a fixed point appears off axis (Barrel and Pincushion Distortion)	Common in display projectors. Caused by a defect in optic lens system. Adjust keystone setting.
Distorted Image	Image appears skewed, or off-centered	Typically caused by power problems or from other large appliances drawing from the same power source. Try using a new power source
Flickering Image	Image Wavers or varies in brightness on the screen.	Data connections loose. / Display not supported(so lower resolution settings)/ Incompatible drivers
Overheat shutdown	Screen turns black but computer is still on	Typically an issue with high end graphics cards. Cooling systems aren't operating, too hot environment, overclocked hardware
Oversized Images	Icons, font, etc are too big	Windows Diisplay settings for the size of the text/icons and set them to the correct settings.
